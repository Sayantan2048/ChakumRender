1. Print the name of variable CFLAGS:
$(info $(CFLAGS)) or @echo $(CFLAGS)

2. Print a string
$(info BAGOM BAGOM BAGOM) or @echo BAGOM BAGOM

3. Surprise, the above statement will execute only once. So, if you want to print a statement everytime a makefile is executed, you need to:
.PHONY: run
run:
	$(info BAGOM BAGOM BAGOM) or @echo BAGOM BAGOM
	
Note: Phony targets are not actual file. Actual files targets are comiled only when their content is changed. If you declare a target Phony, it means it will be
executed without any constraints.
